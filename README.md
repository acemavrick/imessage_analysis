# iMessage Analysis
A tool to export and build an sqlite database of desired iMessage conversations.
Builds upon [imessage-exporter](https://github.com/ReagentX/imessage-exporter).

Coming Soon: a Jupyter Notebook that enables statistical analysis of various aspects of conversations.

## Known Bugs
There seems to be a bug in the imessage-exporter itself, where it doesn't export some messages. Predictably, this skews results, but is not something I know how to fix and has to do with the exporter, not the code in this repository.
